                    <p>During my PhD I developed a technique to create material. This technique is built on Allen Forte's set analysis. 
                        It allows me to expand the material from an initial impetus to build a harmonic language that unifies the piece. 
                        From this I can develop either melodic elements or harmonies that tie in together.</p>  
                    <p>A main feature in my work output as a composer and sound artist is the use of different styles as a structural element on 
                        the same level as melody, harmony, rhythm and texture. This pluralistic approach very often leads to the use of multiple 
                        styles within a single composition either in quick succession or even simultaneously.</p>

                        I also use less known packages that might not be in the mainstream. For my PhD I explored a set of experminetal 
                        software called The Composers' Desktop Project (CDP). From this I learnt various new approaches for manipulating sound.</p>

                        I follow the ABRSM syllabus and although exams are not compulsory, I do encourage my students to sit for 
                        these exams as they serve as a good stimulus and a target for progress. Past results show excellent 
                        achievements from my students. Elements of music theory are also covered during these lessons as the 
                        students learn how to analyse the pieces that they are studying.
                    </p>
                    <p> I teach <strong>Piano</strong> and various brass instruments including <strong>Trumpet</strong> and 
                        <strong>French Horn</strong>. In the past I also had students coming for lessons in <strong>Trombone</strong>
                        playing, <strong>Composition</strong> and <strong>Music Theory</strong>.</p>

                            Here accents move around. Phasing has been explored in styles related to minimalism, and electronic music. A classical example of the latter
                            being Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti's <em>Po&egrave;me Symphonique for 100 metronomes</em>. Other composers have battled the tyranny of the barline. Some names to

                        <p>In slide 2 I wanted to juxtapose the different positions of the accents and infact the piece start with the accent misplaced when compared to 
                            the meter of the music.
