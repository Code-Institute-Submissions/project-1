## INTRODUCTION
* [Back to top](#Milestone-Project-1---My-Website-as-a-Musician)

I have had a personal website for over 15 years. Initially it was very simple, single page, hand coded html with very little styling. It was hosted on various free services. Then I improved the styling and content leading to getting my own hosting. Following that I used joomla for my site for a number of years. Now I built the current single-page site.

## UXD
* [Back to top](#Milestone-Project-1---My-Website-as-a-Musician)

This is the latest incarnation of my website. Its main function is to be an extension of my CV and having a place of contact if someone wants to get in touch but does not know my email address.

The plan is to have a single page website with a parallax background. The design should be responsive.

### **Strategy** 
* [Back to top](#Milestone-Project-1---My-Website-as-a-Musician)

--------
**What do I want as the owner of the site?**
* Internet presence  
* Means to communicate with me  
* Portfoilio  
* Brief info about my activities  

-----------
This is my personal website as a musician. It need to serve as an extension of my CV for music related activities.

People who might use the website are:
* someone wanting to learn music; beginners / continuing / pick up an instrument which they played when they were younger  
* performers wanting to perform one of my pieces  
* people wanting to commission a new composition or arrangement 
* artists wanting to collaborate on an art piece which include music or audio  
* someone looking for a conductor for an orchestra or a band.

#### What does it do?
This website gives visitors information about my various activities related to myself as an active musician.
It is targeted at potential clients who would like to use my services as a composer/sound desgner, conductor, performer or teacher.
Visitors have the ability to contact me by using a contact form.

#### How does it work
The website is planned as a single page site. Each section is well separated from the others so that the material is distinct. Extra information can be accessed through more information buttons.  

The menus will scroll up and down so that the user will know that they are still on the same page rather than taken to a different page. This helps the users to keep track of where they are.



### **Scope** 
* [Back to top](#Milestone-Project-1---My-Website-as-a-Musician)

*(based on information from the strategy plane) Which features will be include in the design? Which features are in and which is out (at least for now)? Minimum Viable Product*

* User Tasks - A User Story is used to describe a number of tasks that may be completed in an any order in pursuit of a general goal.




Features to implement

* Activities - some sort of list with some details and possibly extending the information
* A short Bio
* Examples of my compositions with the possibility for the user to listen to these examples
* A way for the user to get in touch without revealing my email address.
* Links to Github and Linkedin


            People who might use the website are:
            * someone wanting to learn music; beginners / continuing / pick up an instrument which they played when they were younger  
            * performers wanting to perform one of my pieces  
            * people wanting to commission a new composition or arrangement 
            * artists wanting to collaborate on an art piece which include music or audio  
            * someone looking for a conductor for an orchestra or a band.

### User stories
A potential student wanting to learn an instrument can read about my teaching and then directed to  get in touch through the online form.


**Structure** - Structure and logical grouping of the information

Interaction Design / Information Architecture

* Navigation / Routing

projects undertaken. Interaction design is concerned with patterns and sequences
that provide options to the user the patterns might be the navigation, the
order of the menu items, the navigation we tend to read from left to right so
you might want to prioritize your top level information on the on the left
with diminishing priority as you moved from left to right. You might decide on
the relationships between the information you might decide that
personal information should go beside a personal pitch. You might decide that
work history sits really well with skills summary. You might decide that the
request for a collaboration go on its own area you might decide that the
developer is a part of and finally priority six is the ability to download
a CV. Next having put the bulk of the tasks and assignments required at the



**Skeleton** - Representation of the information, Navigation around the site to locate the information and reach the features.
Content relationship / Priority (position of content)

Responsive design
Different parts instead of separate pages  


the two key areas
of interest here are interface design and navigation design. 
Interface design
is concerned with the best arrangement and visual presentation of the elements
navigation design is concerned with intuitive navigation and the completion
of tasks. At this point we also create what are called mock-ups. Mock-ups give us a
good idea of how well constructed our information architecture is and also the
arrangement of our features.

Placement of things
Ex: we'll place our navigation in the upper region which is common and conventional

so based on our
information architecture we prioritized our personal info and our pitch as being
priority one so when a prospective employer arrives at your site for the
first time they'll immediately be able to determine your personal info and your
personal pitch we arranged these also using roughly the law of thirds so the
personal info takes up one third of the width of the screen and the pitch takes
up two thirds. The same arrangement is put in place for the profile image
and the name, the title and the menu items associated with a developer and we
maintain that structure and arrangement throughout the site. The header and the
footer are the same and our main content areas the shape of those areas is the
same what's changed is the actual content. This reassures the user they've already
been exposed to this pattern on the home page now in the resume page this pattern
is repeated so the work history takes up one third, my skills takes up two thirds
now while they project submission our project request form is slightly
different it's still balanced we still have the header at the top we still have
the footer at the bottom the navigation hasn't changed also in terms of
navigation let's go back here the priority of our content is reflected in
the navigation so home represents our personal info on our pitch that's on the
left and then we move to resume to contact to download CV now you might be
wondering well there's only four menu items here where is the links to our
github repositories and the links to meetups and our organizations and so on
well the reason they're not shown here is because in this particular module
we're using solely CSS and HTML now we are using bootstrap as well with it but
only in the context of CSS and HTML itself for the grid in the next module
we'll build up our JavaScript skills to the point where we can implement the
meetups and they github repositories because those sections will require
JavaScript and having carried out the tasks the activities and the information
gathering an organization across the strategy, the scope, the structure and the
skeleton planes we then move on to the final plane which is the surface






**Surface** - Look and feel of the finished product; Colors, Typography; Images; Design Elements - animations, transitions, effects
Monochromatic with some contrasting collors for CTA (buttons). Use gradients in background to avoid the monotony of a flat gray background. 
Use parallax background in alternating sections to create interest and break the grey background.



The surface is the most concrete plane this is what the user gets to see the final
product so it's concerned with color, typography,
effects and imagery. It tries to reinforce the meaning of the
content and guide the user to tasks and information in an intuitive way. It's
also concerned with minimising cognitive overload and maximizing intuitive
learning and it's also concerned with the appropriate content.

example  dark band on the top a dark band at the bottom so our
header and our footer have similar colors and they will be repeated across
the homepage, the resume, the contact
The content itself our main content across each page
will take the format of 1/3 and 2/3 
providing a visual balance 
we've also
split our footer information into thirds as well so we have another about me
another opportunity to download the CV and the social icons which could link to
Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn and so on 



### Colors 

**Heading color**:  
rgb(255, 233, 184) is taken from music background image.  

**Background color** (For non-parallax sections):  
Using a gradient (from [colorzilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/)) which I like better. (*changed from a fixed #50596d*)

**Text color**:  
rgb(25, 39, 51) (*changed from #D5D5D5*) for grey gradient backgrounds and color: rgb(255, 233, 184) (same as header) for text on triangular background, including about me, quote and footer. 

**footer &lt;a&gt; color**:  
rgb(255, 233, 184) and rgb(255, 195, 66) when hovered. Text of links will slightly increase in size on hover too.    
Same colors are used for links in **About Me**.

**Form error color**:  
#e2631f  

**Button colors** (complementary colors):  
* **Primary CTA** : rgb(253, 134, 29) #fd861d
* **Secondary CTA** : rgb(92, 123, 128) #5c7b80

Set all buttons in soundcloud to value %2364746c (a sort of green). This color code is one of the standard soundcloud colors.

*Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.*

*In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:*

*As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.*

*This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.*

## FEATURES

### Existing Features

Navigation is through a menu which appears as a button for mobiles and tablets, and as a fixed menu at the top of the page in desktop view. 
Clicking on a menu item will start a smooth scrolling to the top of that section within the page. This is done in order not to confuse the user in thinking that this is a new page.

Also the menu keeps track of which section a user is currently in. The menu item for the current section is highlighted with a darker background. This acts as a sort of breadcrumb.

Parallax background gives the page a feel of progressing since the foreground scrolls against something which is fixed. To a lesser extent the gradient background helps create a sense of movement while scrollign too.

Each section in the activities allow the user to read about that particular activity. The *Tell me more . . .* button displays further information.

The About me section is a short bio. The link to my linkedin allows a reader to find more about me.

The portfolio allows the user to listen to some examples of my music from soundcloud and youtube.

The contact form - through email.js  allows the user to get in touch with me enabling all the tasks which depend on this, asking for scores, performance / conducting opportunities, composition / sound design / arrangement / collaboration propositions, questions about tuition.
A modal will appear to confirm to the user that the message has been sent.
Since I am actually using this project, I did make the contact form functional.


### Features Left to Implement

1. In the future I might add a complete list of my compositions with details of instrumentation and details about performances.
2. Add current and future activities.



## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3) - used for styling this project.
describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
- [jQuery v3.3.1](https://jquery.com) - simplifies accessing the DOM
- [Bootstrap v3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - used for some of the styles (modified) as well as layout of the content.
- [Font Awesome v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) - used to display the GitHub Icon
- [email.js](http://www.emailjs.com/) - used to enable the contact form to send emails to me.

## TESTING
*In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.*

*Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.*

*For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:*

*Contact form:*
*Go to the "Contact Us" page*
*Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears*
*Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears*
*Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*
*In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.*

*You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.*

*If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*

## Testing
Document testing - will do manual testing using Chrome.


1. css link - set body background color to red. Pass (before it was white)
2. script.js link - append hello world div using jQuery. Checked in Chrome. Pass  
Noticed that links for bootstrap (both css and js are not loading.)
3. Changed links for bootstrap - now loading. Checked with Chrome.
4. Gave (main sections) divs a temp class with a border and some height. Pass Checked with Chrome.
5. When I click the Tell me more button for the composition section, a new div is displayed below the activities section. Pass  
6. Test that all other buttons work. Pass. All 
7. The code for scrolling to the newly displayed info is working well. Pass. Checked with Chrome
8. Extra info is hidden when a new activity is selected Pass
9. Page scrolls back to the top of the calling activity when extra info is closed. Pass
10. When extra info is closed its height is reduced while scrolling. Pass - This makes the action smoother. Especially for the lower cards where the scrolling is slower and might not hide the place previously taken by the extra info just closed.
11. Fixed problem created from unequal sizes of activities cards. Pass
12. Hide images in portfolio in extra small. Pass
13. Tested media query for margin in composition portfolio. Pass
14. Changed jQuery code that shows current year in copyright note with javaScript as it was waiting to load everything including the 
code from SoundCloud. This was resulting in the page sitting note showing the correct copyright note. Pass
15. The contact form itself is has no back end and will not submit anything. 
    To indicate some activity I added jQuery code to display an alert when the contact form is submitted. This was tested. Pass
16. Added validation code. Tested - Pass
17. Added code that will hide the collapsed menu when an item is selected. Pass








### Cleaning and validating code

* **HTML** - https://validator.w3.org/  
There are a number of warnings for the iframes realted to the code from soundcloud. The validator complains about width beign set to 100%. I tried removing this and the iframe will only occupy half the width I want. With width="100%" it works and fills all the space available.

* **CSS** - https://validator.w3.org/  
It complains about vendor prefixes in code that comes from colorzilla (re background gradient) or was added by form validator. I am goind to leave these as they are.  
There is also another warning about two classes having the same background and border colors. I will keep these as they are.

* **Form Validator** - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation

* **JavaScript** - http://esprima.org/demo/validate.html
Code is syntactically valid.


## DEPLOYMENT
*This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).*

*In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:*

*Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?*
*Different configuration files?*
*Separate git branch?*
*In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.*

This the the [github repository](https://github.com/abonello/project-1),  
and this project is deployed as a github page [here](https://abonello.github.io/project-1/).

### Code from other sources

Apart from the code from Bootstrap, I am using code provided by soundcloud and youtube to access the material on
these sites.  
The code for scrolling is adapted from various tutorials. I have modified it and used it before in various projects.
It is heavily documented on youtube and elsewhere.
