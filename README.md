## INTRODUCTION
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

I have had a personal website for over 15 years. Initially it was very simple, single page, hand coded html with very little styling. It was hosted on various free services. Then I improved the styling and content leading to getting my own hosting. Following that I used joomla for my site for a number of years. Now I built the current single-page site.

## UXD
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

This is the latest incarnation of my website. Its main function is to be an extension of my CV and having a place of contact if someone wants to get in touch but does not know my email address.

The plan is to have a single page website with a parallax background. The design should be responsive.

### **Strategy** 
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

--------
**What do I want as the owner of the site?**
* Internet presence  
* Means to communicate with me  
* Portfoilio  
* Brief info about my activities  

-----------
This is my personal website as a musician. It need to serve as an extension of my CV for music related activities.

People who might use the website are:
* someone wanting to learn music; beginners / continuing / pick up an instrument which they played when they were younger  
* performers wanting to perform one of my pieces  
* people wanting to commission a new composition or arrangement 
* artists wanting to collaborate on an art piece which include music or audio  
* someone looking for a conductor for an orchestra or a band.

#### What does it do?
This website gives visitors information about my various activities related to myself as an active musician.
It is targeted at potential clients who would like to use my services as a composer/sound desgner, conductor, performer or teacher.
Visitors have the ability to contact me by using a contact form.

#### How does it work
The website is planned as a single page site. Each section is well separated from the others so that the material is distinct. Extra information can be accessed through more information buttons.  

The menus will scroll up and down so that the user will know that they are still on the same page rather than taken to a different page. This helps the users to keep track of where they are.



### **Scope** 
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

### Features to implement

* Activities - some sort of list with some details and possibly extending the information
* A short Bio
* Examples of my compositions with the possibility for the user to listen to these examples
* A way for the user to get in touch without revealing my email address.
* Links to Github and Linkedin

### User stories
A potential student (or a parent) wanting to learn an instrument can read about my teaching and then directed to  get in touch through the online form.

A performer wanting to play one of my pieces comes to the site to get in touch and ask for scores. The performer is given the opportunity to find out more and directed to the contact form.

A fixer for a music group is looking for a french horn player. The fixer will be directed to the contact form.

A person is interested in commissioning a new piece (acoustic / electroacoustic / mixed). This person will have the opportunity to read about me as a musician and offered the possibility to start communicating and ask questions through the contact form.

A music group representative needs a conductor, perhaps to step in for their regular conductor. This person will have the opportunity to read about me as a musician and in particular, me as a conductor. There will also be the opportunity to get in touch and ask questions.

An artist (ex visual artist) has an idea to build an installation and would like to include sound, perhaps self-generating sound depending on the movement of people within the installation space.
This artist will have the opportunity to read about my compositions and also to listen to some examples. There will be the opportunity to get in touch through the online contact form.

**Structure** - Structure and logical grouping of the information

        Interaction Design / Information Architecture

        * Navigation / Routing

        projects undertaken. Interaction design is concerned with patterns and sequences
        that provide options to the user the patterns might be the navigation, the
        order of the menu items, the navigation we tend to read from left to right so
        you might want to prioritize your top level information on the on the left
        with diminishing priority as you moved from left to right. You might decide on
        the relationships between the information you might decide that
        personal information should go beside a personal pitch. You might decide that
        work history sits really well with skills summary. You might decide that the
        request for a collaboration go on its own area you might decide that the
        developer is a part of and finally priority six is the ability to download
        a CV. Next having put the bulk of the tasks and assignments required at the



**Skeleton** - Representation of the information, Navigation around the site to locate the information and reach the features.
Content relationship / Priority (position of content)

        Responsive design
        Different parts instead of separate pages  


        the two key areas
        of interest here are interface design and navigation design. 
        Interface design
        is concerned with the best arrangement and visual presentation of the elements
        navigation design is concerned with intuitive navigation and the completion
        of tasks. At this point we also create what are called mock-ups. Mock-ups give us a
        good idea of how well constructed our information architecture is and also the
        arrangement of our features.

        Placement of things
        Ex: we'll place our navigation in the upper region which is common and conventional

        so based on our
        information architecture we prioritized our personal info and our pitch as being
        priority one so when a prospective employer arrives at your site for the
        first time they'll immediately be able to determine your personal info and your
        personal pitch we arranged these also using roughly the law of thirds so the
        personal info takes up one third of the width of the screen and the pitch takes
        up two thirds. The same arrangement is put in place for the profile image
        and the name, the title and the menu items associated with a developer and we
        maintain that structure and arrangement throughout the site. The header and the
        footer are the same and our main content areas the shape of those areas is the
        same what's changed is the actual content. This reassures the user they've already
        been exposed to this pattern on the home page now in the resume page this pattern
        is repeated so the work history takes up one third, my skills takes up two thirds
        now while they project submission our project request form is slightly
        different it's still balanced we still have the header at the top we still have
        the footer at the bottom the navigation hasn't changed also in terms of
        navigation let's go back here the priority of our content is reflected in
        the navigation so home represents our personal info on our pitch that's on the
        left and then we move to resume to contact to download CV now you might be
        wondering well there's only four menu items here where is the links to our
        github repositories and the links to meetups and our organizations and so on
        well the reason they're not shown here is because in this particular module
        we're using solely CSS and HTML now we are using bootstrap as well with it but
        only in the context of CSS and HTML itself for the grid in the next module
        we'll build up our JavaScript skills to the point where we can implement the
        meetups and they github repositories because those sections will require
        JavaScript and having carried out the tasks the activities and the information
        gathering an organization across the strategy, the scope, the structure and the
        skeleton planes we then move on to the final plane which is the surface






**Surface** - Look and feel of the finished product; Colors, Typography; Images; Design Elements - animations, transitions, effects

        Monochromatic with some contrasting collors for CTA (buttons). Use gradients in background to avoid the monotony of a flat gray background. 
        Use parallax background in alternating sections to create interest and break the grey background.



        The surface is the most concrete plane this is what the user gets to see the final
        product so it's concerned with color, typography,
        effects and imagery. It tries to reinforce the meaning of the
        content and guide the user to tasks and information in an intuitive way. It's
        also concerned with minimising cognitive overload and maximizing intuitive
        learning and it's also concerned with the appropriate content.

        example  dark band on the top a dark band at the bottom so our
        header and our footer have similar colors and they will be repeated across
        the homepage, the resume, the contact
        The content itself our main content across each page
        will take the format of 1/3 and 2/3 
        providing a visual balance 
        we've also
        split our footer information into thirds as well so we have another about me
        another opportunity to download the CV and the social icons which could link to
        Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn and so on 



### Colors 

**Heading color**:  
rgb(255, 233, 184) is taken from music background image.  

**Background color** (For non-parallax sections):  
Using a gradient (from [colorzilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/)) which I like better. (*changed from a fixed #50596d*)

**Text color**:  
rgb(25, 39, 51) (*changed from #D5D5D5*) for grey gradient backgrounds and color: rgb(255, 233, 184) (same as header) for text on triangular background, including about me, quote and footer. 

**footer &lt;a&gt; color**:  
rgb(255, 233, 184) and rgb(255, 195, 66) when hovered. Text of links will slightly increase in size on hover too.    
Same colors are used for links in **About Me**.

**Form error color**:  
#e2631f  

**Button colors** (complementary colors):  
* **Primary CTA** : rgb(253, 134, 29) #fd861d
* **Secondary CTA** : rgb(92, 123, 128) #5c7b80

Set all buttons in soundcloud to value %2364746c (a sort of green). This color code is one of the standard soundcloud colors.

        *Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.*

        *In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:*

        *As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.*

        *This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.*

## FEATURES
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

### Existing Features

Navigation is through a menu which appears as a button for mobiles and tablets, and as a fixed menu at the top of the page in desktop view. 
Clicking on a menu item will start a smooth scrolling to the top of that section within the page. This is done in order not to confuse the user in thinking that this is a new page.

Also the menu keeps track of which section a user is currently in. The menu item for the current section is highlighted with a darker background. This acts as a sort of breadcrumb.

Parallax background gives the page a feel of progressing since the foreground scrolls against something which is fixed. To a lesser extent the gradient background helps create a sense of movement while scrollign too.

Each section in the activities allow the user to read about that particular activity. The *Tell me more ...* button displays further information.

The About me section is a short bio. The link to my linkedin allows a reader to find more about me.

The portfolio allows the user to listen to some examples of my music from soundcloud and youtube.

The contact form - through email.js  allows the user to get in touch with me enabling all the tasks which depend on this, asking for scores, performance / conducting opportunities, composition / sound design / arrangement / collaboration propositions, questions about tuition.
A modal will appear to confirm to the user that the message has been sent.
Since I am actually using this project, I did make the contact form functional.


### Features Left to Implement

1. Improve the functionality of the CTA button on mobiles. It should direct teh user to the top of the contact form. Instead it is directing the user to the submit button. The user has to scroll back up.
2. In the future I might add a complete list of my compositions with details of instrumentation and details about performances.
3. Add current and future activities.
4. Fix parallax for mobiles

## TESTING
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

### Manual testing using Chrome.
Example of testing steps:  
1. css link - set body background color to red. Pass (before it was white)
2. script.js link - append hello world div using jQuery. Checked in Chrome. Pass  
Noticed that links for bootstrap (both css and js are not loading.)
3. Changed links for bootstrap - now loading. Checked with Chrome.
4. Gave (main sections) divs a temp class with a border and some height. Pass Checked with Chrome.
5. When I click the Tell me more button for the composition section, a new div is displayed below the activities section. Pass  
6. Test that all other buttons work. Pass. All 
7. The code for scrolling to the newly displayed info is working well. Pass. Checked with Chrome
8. Extra info is hidden when a new activity is selected Pass
9. Page scrolls back to the top of the calling activity when extra info is closed. Pass
10. When extra info is closed its height is reduced while scrolling. Pass - This makes the action smoother. Especially for the lower cards where the scrolling is slower and might not hide the place previously taken by the extra info just closed.
11. Fixed problem created from unequal sizes of activities cards. Pass
12. Hide images in portfolio in extra small. Pass
13. Tested media query for margin in composition portfolio. Pass
14. Changed jQuery code that shows current year in copyright note with javaScript as it was waiting to load everything including the 
code from SoundCloud. This was resulting in the page sitting note showing the correct copyright note. Pass
15. The contact form itself is has no back end and will not submit anything. 
    To indicate some activity I added jQuery code to display an alert when the contact form is submitted. This was tested. Pass
16. Added validation code. Tested - Pass
17. Added code that will hide the collapsed menu when an item is selected. Pass

### Manual Testing - User Stories

* A student / parent is looking for a music teacher:  
    1. The user comes to the page
    2. Clicks on activites in the menu (or scrolls down manually to the activities section)
    3. Reaches the Music Tuition part
    4. Clicks on the *Tell me more ...* button (secondary CTA)
    5. Reads the content
    6. Press the *get in touch* button (primary CTA)

**Test pass on desktop. On mobiles I found that the user is taken to the submit button. I would like to improve on this later.**

-----

* A performer wants to play one of my pieces: *could have heard it someone else or looking for anything I can provide*  
    1. The user comes to the page
    2. Clicks on activites in the menu (or scrolls down manually to the activities section)
    3. Reaches the Composition part
    4. Clicks on the *Tell me more ...* button (secondary CTA)
    5. Reads the content
    6. Press the *get in touch* button (primary CTA)

**Test pass on desktop. On mobiles I found that the user is taken to the submit button. I would like to improve on this later.**

-----

* Someone is looking for a french horn performer:
    1. The user comes to the page
    2. Clicks on activites in the menu (or scrolls down manually to the activities section)
    3. Reaches the Performance part
    4. Press the *get in touch* button (primary CTA)

**Test pass on desktop. On mobiles I found that the user is taken to the submit button. I would like to improve on this later.**

-----

* A person would like to commission a new composition.  

    There are multiple routes such a user can take.
    If someone looked for me to commission a piece, that person would know something about my music. Otherwise this person will:

    1. Come to my page
    2. Click on the Portfolio in the menu
    3. The user will click on the various buttons to listen to some of my music.
    4. When the user has listened enough, they might choose to contact me.  
        They will reach the contact form either through the contact menu item or by scrolling to the bottom of the page. Listeneing to music takes time and if the user is ready to stay and listen they will have all the time to explore the whole page.

    In any case commissioning a piece of music is not a decision taken there and then but will involve a lengthy communication.

**Test Pass. Contact form tested separately.**

-----

* Someone is looking for a conductor
    1. Come to the page
    2. Click on Activities from the menu
    3. Read various sections such as conducting / composition /sound design
        Each extended section has a close button that will take the user back to the calling activity.
        There is a primary CTA button in case the user is ready to get in touch.
    4. The user might also choose to read more about me and possibly extend to the Linkein profile.
    5. When the user is ready, they can use the contact form to contact me (or if they are in linked in, they might choose to contact me from there).

**All tested and works well**

-----

* An visual artist wants to collaborate on a multimedia project:

    1. The artist comes to my site
    2. Read various sections from my activities including the extended sections. Possibilities include composition / sound design / research
    3. If the user feels ready to contact me, a CTA button is available
    4. Alternatively the artist might want to read more about me in which case s/he will go to the About Me either by scrolling or by using the navigation buttons. There is the possibility to reach my Linkein.
    5. The artist might decide to listen to some of my music from the portfolio
    6. When the artist want to get in touch there are various routes available. In the section where the CTA button is available this will take the user straight to the contact form. Otherwise they user can scroll to the contact form or use the Contact link in the navigation bar.

**All tested and works well**

-----

* Testing the contact form
Test reaching the contact form from various places. PASS with the exception that the CTA buttons will take the user to the submit button on mobile devices.
    1. Submitting empty form: **Error message shown to user prompting to fill in the name**
    2. User fills in only name and trying to submit: **Error message shown prompting user to fill in email**
    3. User fills in first part of email only (Ex. asdf): **Error message showing that the email lacks an @ symbol**
    4. User adds @ symbol and tries to submit: **Error message telling the user that the part following the @ symbol is missing**
    5. User completes the name and email and leaves the rest of the form empty: **Error message prompting the user to fill in a subject**
    6. User fills in the name, email with correct format and subject and tries to submit: **Error message prompting user to write a text message**  
        Following this typing less than 3 letters, an error message prompts the user that the message should be at least three letters long. (This is an arbitrary number.)
    7. Trying to send a filled in form with a fictitious email that passes the format test (EX: asdf@asdfg.saf): **Error modal saying that Send email failed**.  
    This is due to "Sender verify failed error" raised by the email server.
    This offers me some protection from receiving spam from people who try to mimic an email address.


### Mobile / Tablet testing

Apart from using Chrome developer tools to test the layout and functionality of the page in a mobile and tablet layouts, I also tested the site on my mobile phone and that of my friend. Both are android phones.  

The site is responsive and everything seems to work well in chrome developer tools. However when viewed on a real phone I noticed that the parallax background is not working as intended. In these cases it gracefully degrades to a normal background that scrolls with the page.

I found that this is browser dependent. Google Chrome (Mobile v68.03440.91) does not display the parallax background as intended, but Firefox (Mobile v61.0.2) does. I googled for any solutions but none suggested are working.

I also noted that the CTA button on mobiles will direct the user to the submit button of the form. The user will have to scroll back up. (This functionality works well on desktop.) It is something that I will work on later.

### bugs 

As mentioned in the testing section above, when the CTA button is clicked in mobile devices the user is taken to the submit button instead of the top of the contact form. I tried to look into this but I cannot find a way to improve on this at the moment. I consider this bug as high priority to fix.

The other bug is the background parallax effect. It does not work on all mobile browsers. I researched this on google but none of the fixes I came across weem to work. This is not a high priority bug as the site still looks and functions well without the parallax effect.


### Cleaning and validating code

* **HTML** - https://validator.w3.org/  
There are a number of warnings for the iframes realted to the code from soundcloud. The validator complains about width beign set to 100%. I tried removing this and the iframe will only occupy half the width I want. With width="100%" it works and fills all the space available.

* **CSS** - https://validator.w3.org/  
It complains about vendor prefixes in code that comes from colorzilla (re background gradient) or was added by form validator. I am goind to leave these as they are.  
There is also another warning about two classes having the same background and border colors. I will keep these as they are.

* **Form Validator** - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation

* **JavaScript** - http://esprima.org/demo/validate.html
Code is syntactically valid.


## DEPLOYMENT
* [Back to top](#milestone-project-1---my-website-as-a-musician)

The repository of this project is at [**github repository**](https://github.com/abonello/project-1),  
and it is deployed as a github page [**here**](https://abonello.github.io/project-1/).

I am also deploying this website as my [live site](anthonybonello.co.uk). This will eventually differ from the project I am submitting for this course.

### Code from other sources
Apart from the code from Bootstrap, I am using code provided by soundcloud and youtube to access the material on
these sites.  
The code for scrolling is adapted from various tutorials. I have modified it and used it before in various projects.
It is heavily documented on youtube and elsewhere.  
[colorzilla](http://colorzilla.com/gradient-editor) to create background gradients.
