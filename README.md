# project-1
This project will form part of my submission for the Fullstack Web Developer course that I am doing at code institute.

This the the [github repository](https://github.com/abonello/project-1),  
and this project will be deployed [here](https://abonello.github.io/project-1/).

I am basing this project on an earlier exercise that I did where I explored the jumbotron and other parts of bootstrap. The plan is to have a single page website with a parallax background. The design is responsive.

## Technologies
html5, CSS3, bootstrap, javascript
