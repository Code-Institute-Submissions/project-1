# project-1

## Overview
### What is this website for?
This project will form part of my submission for the Fullstack Web Developer course that I am doing at code institute.

This the the [github repository](https://github.com/abonello/project-1),  
and this project is deployed as a github page [here](https://abonello.github.io/project-1/).

I am basing this project on an earlier exploratory exercise that I did where I explored the jumbotron and other parts of bootstrap. This previous exercise was meant to be a draft to practice the techniques and skills I need for this project. It can be found [here](https://github.com/abonello/JumbotronExperiment).

The plan is to have a single page website with a parallax background. The design is responsive.

### What does it do?
This website gives visitors information about my various activities related to myself as an active independent musician.
It is targeted at potential clients who would like to use my services as a composer/sound desgner, conductor, performer or teacher.
Visitors have the ability to contact me by using a contact form. (Note: the contact form in this project is not functional as it is beyond the scope of this project to develop a back end.)

### How does it work
The website is planned as a single page site. Each section is well separated from the others so that the material is distinct. Extra information can be accessed through more information buttons.  

The menus will scroll up and down so that the user will know that they are still on the same page rather than taken to a different page. This helps the users to keep trakc of where they are.
